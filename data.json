This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:1.Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 2.The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance.

      "Statement": "Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data ",
      "Description": " The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).AbstractSepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/",

Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm.

      "Description": " An excavator is a construction vehicle used to excavate or move large objects. The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement.The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm & bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick.  The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel  joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM's.When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available.

The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in Government schools. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. Solution Expected: As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging. Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve: Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing & Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the scalability factor of the system. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria: 1. Depth and research to understand Mid-Day meal scheme monitoring problem. 2. Depth of understanding of Meraki camera product capabilities use cases. 3.

Helicopter Turbo-props are the propellers having propulsion system mounted at tip of the blades. The major idea about this is to reduce the travel cost per passenger as turbo props are more efficient, provide high endurance than that of the normal helicopter blades and provides two times the speed to the plane. On the other hand unbearable noise is one of the issue in helicopter turbo-props. In this problem statement, students are supposed to make the working prototype of helicopter turbo-props. These propellers should be designed in such a way that, it should lift and land a foam model of an aircraft weighing 700 grams.

      "Description": " NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant.  N.B:        •Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.•The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.•The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.•If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces. Operation:A.Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).B.After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.  C.From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).D.Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. E.Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).F.Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.G.Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made. Problems:The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.Improvements Desired:To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)Information on availability of vehicle.Live metal temperature data from ladle.Vehicle call request with location.Driver acknowledgement for call request.Vehicle identification through code broadcast.The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.",
