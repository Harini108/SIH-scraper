## A Smart India Hackathon Problem statments scraper

- made for fun
- I wanted to access problem statements offline, so I made this

## To use:

> ### `node . {min-page} {max-page}`

- run `node . 1 15`
- This command scrapes all the problem statements from page `1` to page `15`
- All the problem statements are in `data.json` file
